Description: The goal of colortable is to make it easier to color and style your table elements, and
    view your changes in real time. 
    Current styling technologies make you go to your final printing status before you can see the 
    coloring and styling applied. This adds overhead and iterating on outputs and sometimes require
    compiling entire reports to check minute changes.
    Alternatively, a technique that is common is to hard-code the styling to elements into the table
    using `paste()`. The downside is that this requires complete changes to data types in the tables
    to characters or generation of fields demarked for the final table printing. Checking that the
    syntax is correct requires compiling.
    {colortable} solves this conundrum by allowing the user to keep the types of the contents, and
    applies the style updates on printing. Styling can be previewed in the console at a low level
    prior to the report needing to be compiled, saving iteration time.
