Seamlessly style and print your vectors across Rmarkdown output types through a single interface.
colortable enables users to style and color the contents of their vectors, data.frames, and tibbles through the object, and function, `color_vctr()`. 

At this point, the supported output types include:

<div style="display:inline-block">
<img alt="console" src="inst/media/console_logo.png" height = 80/>
<img alt="html" src="inst/media/html_logo.png" height = 80/>
<img alt="pdf" src="inst/media/pdf_logo.png" height = 80/>
<img alt="Microsoft Word" src="inst/media/microsoft_word_logo.png" height = 80/>
</div>


## Installation

<!-- You can install the released version of colortable from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->

Currently {colortable} is only available on github, and is very much under development.

``` r
remotes::install_github("thebioengineer/colortable")
## install.packages("colortable") ## Not Available on CRAN
```

## Getting Started

{colortable} works by making a special S3 class called a `color_vctr`, and custom print/format functions.

It then has 4 arguments; 
  - The vector to be styled
  - text_color, a vector that is either the color the entire vector to be colored or each element
  - style, a vector is either the style the enture vector to be styled with or each element
  - background, a vector that is either the background color the entire vector to be colored or for each element.
  
Additionally, there is a few helper functions
  - `set_styling()` uses a boolean argument to apply the styling
  - `color_scale()` is to be used for setting colors, accepting a pallette
  
*A note, html styling does not apply in a github readme*

```{r}
library(colortable)

color_vctr(c(1,2,3,4),
           text_color = c("blue","green", "yellow",NA),
           style = c("underline","italic",NA,"bold"),
           background = c(NA,NA,"blue",NA))

color_vctr(LETTERS, text_color = color_scale(colorRamp(c("red","yellow"))))
color_vctr(LETTERS, text_color = color_scale("Blues"))

```

## Example

A common case I have seen for coloring values is from analysis coloring p-values.
Normally, when I have seen this the color is hard-coded in an ifelse statement with a paste0. 
However, this liits the output to a single type. 

The benefit of {{colortable}} is that the same code can be used across outputs and even in the console!


```{r example, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)

## Super Great analysis of mtcars!

lm_fit <- lm(mpg ~ ., mtcars)

a_lm_fit <- anova(lm_fit)

tbl_anova <- a_lm_fit %>% 
  as_tibble()%>% 
  mutate(
    Coef     = rownames(a_lm_fit),
    `Pr(>F)` = set_styling(`Pr(>F)`, `Pr(>F)` < 0.05, background = "green", style = "underline"),
    `Pr(>F)` = set_styling(`Pr(>F)`, is.na(`Pr(>F)`), style = "strikethrough", text_color = "silver"),
    `F value` = set_styling(`F value`, is.na(`F value`), style = "strikethrough", text_color = "silver")
  ) %>% 
  select(Coef, everything())

kable(tbl_anova, escape = FALSE)

```

## Output types

In order to simply generate a color_vctr, use the `color_vctr` function. 
It can convert any atomic (numeric, integer, complex, character, logical, raw) into a color_vctr where text and background colors, and styles can be set.

To see the available styles and colors, use the `valid_*` family of functions: `valid_colors()`or `valid_style()`.
To check whether the styling is a valid type for the output, set the method to be "latex" for pdf outputs, or "html" for html outputs.

Below is a random sampling of output types to the console:

```{r, eval = FALSE}

data.frame(
  text_color = sample(c(NA, valid_text_color()),10, replace = TRUE),
  background = sample(c(NA, valid_background()),10, replace = TRUE),
  style      = sample(c(NA, valid_style()),10, replace = TRUE),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    background = ifelse(text_color == background, 
                  sample(c(NA, valid_background()),10, replace = TRUE),
                  background)
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
  example = color_vctr(runif(10),
                       text_color = text_color,
                       background = background,
                       style = style)
  )

```

## Inspiration
This idea was inspired by [`crayon`](https://github.com/r-lib/crayon), and has some elements based on it. I thank all the developers of that project!
Since then, I have been insprired by ['flextable'](https://github.com/davidgohel/officedown) for word development.

Current styling technologies such as {kableExtra} and {formattable} also inspired the development of this project.
